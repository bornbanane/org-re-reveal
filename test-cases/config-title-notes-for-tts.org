Personally, the author of this software does not like learning from
videos as they exhibit limited navigation capabilities (no skim
reading, limited search, no document structure, no hyperlinks).  His
students like videos, though.

Maintaining high-quality video and audio over years is a considerable
challenge.  To overcome this challenge, revealjs presentations
can be run in a video mode where slides come with audio explanations
and advance automatically.  This presentation serves as example.
