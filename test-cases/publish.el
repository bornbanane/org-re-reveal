;;; Commentary:
;; Publication of Org source files to reveal.js uses Org export
;; functionality offered by org-re-reveal and oer-reveal.
;; Initialization code for both is provided by emacs-reveal, e.g.,
;; in the Docker image emacs-reveal: https://gitlab.com/oer/docker
;; Org-re-reveal and oer-reveal are also available on MELPA.
;;
;; Use this file from its parent directory with the following shell
;; command:
;; emacs --batch -L /root/.emacs.d/elpa/emacs-reveal/org-mode/lisp --load org-re-reveal.el --load test-cases/publish.el

;;; Code:
(package-initialize)
